# HU-V2CPSE1-Homework

Everything is designed to work with my fork of [hwlib](https://github.com/Fusion86/hwlib) and [bmptk](https://github.com/Fusion86/bmptk).  
Most things will work just fine on the original version, but if they don't then that's your problem.

I can barely count to ten, which means that all math and formulas used here are just stupid copy/paste.  
I didn't actually spend any time optimizing those (not that I could).
